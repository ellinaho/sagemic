# sagemic
Real-time detection and classification of bioacoustic events on field devices built around microphone-enabled single-board computers, with capabilities to do inference on-device and via streaming data to a remote server. 

## SageMic
Currently: sagemic_local.py
Sagemic is an acoustic inference device that runs Birdnet continuously and stores detections locally. 

Current versions in development include LTE enabled and Wifi Halow versions where detections are sent through an MQTT Broker.

Can use different microphones, but has been tested with an Audiomoth set to 48000Hz, or an INMP441 mic (additional setup instructions below).

### Installation
Flash a Bookworm Desktop OS for Raspberry Pi 4B. Trixie and Pi 5 compatible, but Trixie requires 1 extra step.

If using Trixie, Python3.11 needs to be
installed because Tensorflow is not yet fully comptaible with Python3.13, which is what Trixie has.

To create a non-replacing install of Python3.11, run these commands to build an alternate install of Python3.11 we can use in our venv.

If using Bookworm, skip to the step where we create the python environment.

```
su - root
apt install -y build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev libsqlite3-dev wget libbz2-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev
cd ~ && wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.13/Python-3.11.13.tar.xz
tar xvf Python-3.11.13.tar.xz && cd Python-3.11.13
./configure --enable-optimizations --with-ensurepip=install
make -j $(nproc) && make altinstall
```

If using Trixie, and you did the above altinstall, use this command to create the env.
```
python3.11 -m venv .sagemic
```

If using Bookworm, you can just use python3
```
python3 -m venv .sagemic
```

Bookworm and Trixie instructions converge here:

```
source .sagemic/bin/activate

git clone https://github.com/conservationtechlab/sagemic.git
cd ~/sagemic
pip install -e .
sudo apt-get install libportaudio2
```

To test, run 'run_birdnet_on_microphone_stream.py' inside /feature_tests.

To run continuously on boot, make a copy of config/example_config/yaml and follow the instructions inside /systemd to have sagemic_local.service
run the sagemic software continuously on boots. 

### Scan Send
See the readme in /systemd for instructions to enable the scansend service that will periodically check for new audio clips and transmit them over
MQTTS. See this repo [SageBRUSH-Xylem](https://github.com/conservationtechlab/sagebrush-xylem) for instructions on how to set up the MQTT Broker service and generate new keys needed to paste in the config file to allow for secure transmission
of audio clips.


## Birbler
Currently: sagemic_stream.py (runs on remote server, with instruction steps for pi below)
Device streams its audio to a local server where inference runs there. 

Installation (on Pi):

```
sudo apt install ffmpeg
wget https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/releases/download/v1.8.3/mediamtx_v1.8.3_linux_arm64v8.tar.gz
tar xzvf mediamtx_v1.8.3_linux_arm64v8.tar.gz 
sudo mv mediamtx /usr/local/bin/
sudo nano mediamtx.yml
```
Add these lines to the end of the file:
```
paths:
  stream:
    runOnInit: ffmpeg -f alsa -channels 1 -i hw:3,0 -ar 48000 -acodec libmp3lame -f rtsp -rtsp_transport tcp rtsp://localhost:8554/stream
    runOnInitRestart: yes
```
If mic on pi is a different device (not hw:3,0), run:
```
arecord -l
```
to see which device to swap in that param.
Start server with:
```
mediamtx mediamtx.yml
```
If you'd like the stream to start automatically, after reboots
make it a systemd service:
```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mediamtx.service
```
Paste this into the opened file:
```
[Unit]
Description=MediaMTX RTSP/RTMP Server
After=network.target
Wants=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/mediamtx /home/ctl/mediamtx.yml
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
User=<YOUR USER>
WorkingDirectory=<HOME DIR>

NoNewPrivileges=true
PrivateTmp=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Replace your user and your home directory, save and close.
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable mediamtx
sudo systemctl start mediamtx
```
To test your stream, on your local machine run:
```
ffplay -rtsp_transport tcp rtsp://<pi ip>:8554/stream
```
Listen with headphones if the recorder is in the same room, otherwise you'll hear
feedback from the playback.

Installation (on remote machine or local machine running inference):

Clone this repo. Install necessary packages.

Input your ip of your pi and other params set for the stream as
the STREAM_URL in sagemic_stream.py, and set the BASE_PATH to what
directory you'd like detections saved to. Run sagemic_stream.py on
your local machine and it will run inference on the rtsp stream
of audio provided by the remote pi. 
Note, birdnetlib expects 48kHz input.

## INMP441 Setup
No extra installation needed. Only need to add to config.txt

Pin configurations (INMP441 - 40 pin Pi)
SCK - Pin 12 (GPIO 18 PCM Clock)
SD - Pin 38 (GPIO 20, PCM In)
WS - Pin 35 (GPIO 19, PCM FS)
L/R - GND (For left channel)
VDD - 3.3V
GND - gnd

Add the following to your `/boot/firmware/config.txt`
```
dtparam=i2s=on
dtoverlay=googlevoicehat-soundcard
```

Then reboot your pi:
`sudo reboot`

Then you are all setup for using INMP441 :)
